title: About the Bakery Project

Bakery is a font build service. The vision is to bring the [Continuous Integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) best practices of software development to [type design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_design).

You give it a font project git repository, tell it which license the project is under, which font source files you wish to build into binaries, and set some build options. It then builds these fonts and runs tests on both sources and binaries.

In July 2013, this project is under active development by Mikhail Kashkin and Dave Crossland.
