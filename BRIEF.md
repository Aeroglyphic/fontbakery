# Font Bakery Product Requirements Document

The Font Bakery project develops tools for font production.

This document sets out the product's requirements and design principles, what designers call a "brief."

**Note: The command examples below set out how tools ought to work, and are not examples for use, just yet.**

## 1. Purpose

The primary purpose of the project is to accelerate the on-boarding of font families into the Google Fonts library, both new families and updates to exisiting ones. 

To achieve this we develop tools to sanity-check and fix the files that comprise a single Google Fonts family: TTF fonts, an API metadata file, and a description file. 

These tools are used by @davelab6 to onboard both new families and updates to existing families. 
By making them available to all type designers and font engineers, we hope to empower everyone to get their font projects into a complete and tested state and ready to onboard into Google Fonts. 
The tools will act as an educational resource for type designers to learn about technical quality issues, because if font designers do the right early on that reduces the amount of work at project delivery time. 

The tools are command-line based to allow work on various platforms in a consistent and reproducible way.
They reflect the [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy):

* Do one thing and do it well, 
* work together, and
* work in similar/uniform way.

A suite of small command-line tools is preferable to a large object oriented application with a graphical user interface.
The tools are individually simple, on the level of shell scripting, and written in Python. 
The use of Python allows direct access to internal font tables using the fonttools package, already popular with the professional font development community. 

Existing font checking tools from other projects and companies are integrated to avoid duplication, such as Apple's `ftxvalidator` tool and Microsoft's Font Validator.

While developing font bakery, we aim to avoid development distractions. 
For example, to access internet resources we may use our own native Python utility methods for simple cases, and [GNU wget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget) or other common system utilities for more complex cases (such as resuming large files.)

#### 1.1 terminology

An individual user-ready font file is normally referred to as a 'TTF' file, because it uses the `.ttf` extension and is in the TrueType flavour of the OpenType font standard.

A font family consists of 1 to 18 font files that belong together because they are designed to work together and share common visual traits. 
Familiar examples are Regular, Bold, Italic, and Bold Italic files.
The Google Fonts API presents these with the same family name. 
Some typeface projects are developed with other platforms in mind (such as Adobe CC Suite tools) that support many more than 18 styles in a family, and in those cases we must adjust the files to work as a set of families of 1â€“18 styles. 
Some Font Bakery tools process a set of files that make up a family that include both font files as well as metadata files. 

Font Bakery tools provide two main actions:

1. 'check' operations
2. 'hotfix' operations

Check operations validate fonts with read-only processes and only output diagnostic information, which in verbose mode includes confirmations; without passing a verbose argument to a tool, if everything is correct then there will be no output. 

Check operations do not modify the input font files in any way, because they are intended to provide feedback to font designers and engineers to decide how to resolve them, such as making corrections to source files and rebuilding the fonts.
Hotfix operations do create new font files, by copying the file and modifying that copy, which is saved on disk with the same filename plus `.fix` appended. 

## 2. Onboarding New and Updated Families

#### 2.1 checking TTFs individually

A single TTF can be validated using:

    ~/fonts/ofl/family $ fontbakery-check-ttf *.ttf ;

In addition to the checks written for Font Bakery, other validation software will also be run to validate the file (such as ots, nototools, Microsoft Font Validator, Apple Font Validator, FontForge, GlyphNanny, etc.)

For example:

    ~/fonts/ofl/family $ for font in `ls -1 *ttf` ; do \
                           echo $font ; ot-sanitise $font ; 
                         done ;

#### 2.2 checking TTFs as a family

A family of TTFs can be validated using:

    ~/fonts/ofl/family$ fontbakery-check-ttf-family *.ttf ;

Some checks must be done by comparing all 1 to 18 font files in a family in order to conclude that their data is correct.

#### 2.3 hot-fixing TTFs

Many common issues can be 'hot fixed.'
A hotfix is a modification to a TTF file itself, a last-minute change, or useful to compare against when fixing the source files and compiling a new font without the issue.

    ~/fonts/ofl/family $ fontbakery-check-ttf *.ttf --autofix ;
    $ rm *.ttf ;
    $ rename s/ttf.fix/ttf/g ;

    ~/fonts/ofl/family $ fontbakery-check-ttf-family *.ttf --autofix ;
    $ rm *.ttf ;
    $ rename s/ttf.fix/ttf/g ;

#### 2.4 generating other required files

A `METADATA.pb` file and `DESCRIPTION.en_us.html` file must be generated:

    ~/fonts/tools $ ./add_font.py ../ofl/family ;

This file can not be generated completely and must be manually edited. 

#### 2.5 checking everything is in sync and correct

    ~/fonts/ofl $ mv family family-old ;
    ~/fonts/ofl $ mv /path/to/new/version family ;
    ~/fonts/tools $ fontbakery-check-family ../ofl/family ;
    ~/fonts/tools $ ./sanity_check.py ../ofl/family ;

#### 2.6 comparing new versions to the ones in production to avoid regressions

    ~/fonts/ofl $ ttx -s family-old/*ttf family/*ttf ;
    $ meld family-old/ family/ ;
    $ rm family-old/*ttx family/*ttx ;

## 3. Collection Management

#### 3.1 Check the entire collection

The ultimate aim is a single master check script that all families pass.

    ~/fonts $ fontbakery-check-collection . ;
    $ 

#### 3.2 Web dashboard

In order to develop the collection to the point all families and fonts pass all tests, we will develop a web dashboard that shows their progress against this goal. 
It will allow a set of upcoming projects to measure their quality, and a 'burn down' chart towards their launch in the directory. 

A live report about the quality of a font project will encourage test-driven-development for fonts. 
Contracts can specify that projects must pass to be considered complete.

The dashboard will integrate with the Github Issues API, to make it convenient to create and track issues based on our reports.

A prototype for this is available at <https://googlefonts.github.io/fontbakery>

## 4. Source Management

Last minute hotfixing of TTFs is ideally unnecessary. 
Our ultimate aim is that all fonts in the Google Fonts catalog have source repositories in [github.com/googlefonts](https://github.com/googlefonts) that are error-free. 
This can be achieved with [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) services like [Travis](https://www.travis-ci.org)) that alert designers about issues and regressions as they happen.

To support this way of developing fonts, we will develop tools for checking font source files.
These source-file focused tools supplement the TTF tools. 
Some font project upstreams do not provide binaries, or only provide OTF fonts, so we will also develop example "build scripts" that automate the compilation of TTF fonts from source files.

#### 4.1 Checking source files individually

These scripts likely need to be run inside font editors, and thus should be packaged as extension for the editors in the normal way. 
However, should it be possible to run them similar to the above TTF check tools, they would work like this:

    ~/fonts/ofl/family $ fontbakery-check-source [*.glyphs, .ufo, .sfd, .vfb, .xfo]

#### 4.2 Building source files into binaries

TODO: Link to SFNTMAKE discussion on fonttools issue tracker

#### 4.3 Setting up Travis

Travis setup is complicated. 
Deployment typically requires the user to copy/paste/tweak a rather complex setup file. 
It could be made simpler by providing scripts to set it up, and we have 3 already:

    ~/fonts/ofl/family $ fontbakery-travis-deploy.py
    ~/fonts/ofl/family $ fontbakery-travis-init.py
    ~/fonts/ofl/family $ fontbakery-travis-secure.sh

We could also add a `fontbakery-travis-check.py` script that checks that it is configured correctly, a build badge is in README, etc.

# v0.1.0 Planning

## Code Review

Each file in the repo was reviewed and irrelevant files deleted (PR #TODO link to it) and the relevant files were as follows:

* bakery_lint/fonttests/* this is where the tests are
* bakery_cli/fixers.py has some fixing methods to rescue
* bakery_cli/fonts_public.proto and its child fonts_public_pb2.py are useful
* bakery_cli/nameid_values.py is useful, I expect to just put that at the top of fontbakery-check-ttf.py (and perhaps later go upstream to fontTools)
* bakery_cli/ttfont.py has a crazy big class that bundles data from different tables into a single fontbakery-unique Font object, and is a very useful reference
* bakery_cli/utils.py has some family checks, some installation checks (like if ttfautohint is available), some `fontbakery-check-family.py` checks...
* bakery_cli/pipe/build.py has things used to build TTFs that should be split out into their own little tools, which can then be used in a setup.py or build.sh or Makefile
* bakery_cli/pipe/copy.py has things for creating a build output directory, and that should be used in a setup.py API
* bakery_cli/pipe/fontcrunch.py is a wrapper for https://github.com/googlefonts/fontcrunch that seems superfluous
* bakery_cli/pipe/optimize.py has things to optimize fonts that should be split into a check to see if the font file is optimized, and if not, run this optimization as an autofix
* bakery_cli/pipe/pyfontaine.py just runs `pyfontaine --collection subsets --text $font >> fontaine.txt` 
* bakery_cli/pipe/ttfautohint.py just runs ttfautohint with the default args and then offers a comparison of the filesize.
* bakery_cli/scripts/font2ttf.py should be its own little standalone tool
* bakery_cli/scripts/genmetadata.py should be its own little standalone tool
* bakery_cli/scripts/stemcalc.py should be part of the fontbakery-check-ttf-family.py
* bakery_cli/scripts/vmet.py should be part of the fontbakery-check-ttf-family.py
* no bakery.yaml file, we will create a standard distutils setup.py for each font repo that builds it and installs it with the standard 'python setup.py install' command, and packages font source projects in the PyPI

## Considerations 

The most simple form for `fontbakery-check-ttf.py` is a linear, imperative programming style. 

It should be structured table by table, and operate on a single ttLib font object.

Use Python standard library logging module. 

* Only have a single log entry for each test

Only interact with TTF or OTF files with fontTools

Only interact with UFOs using defcon, specifically the version of defcon that TruFont uses

Interacting with `.glyphs` files can most simply be done by treating them as plain text files and using standard text processing methods (grep, etc.) The next level of sophistication is using the glyphs2ufo parser; but perhaps a Glyphs extension that runs inside the application's python, and can thus use its internal Glyphs API to autocorrect things, would be the best sophisticated approach.
